## Music and Mental Health Correlation.

### Overview
This dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Mental Health conditions included in the dataset are anxiety, depression, insomnia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The music portion of the dataset is based on Basic Genres of music.

### Dataset
This is the dataset that I got from kaggle: [MxMH_Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results)

### Project Goals
**Compare Mental Health Outcomes Across Age Groups Based on Music Habits:**
Examine whether the correlation between music listening habits and mental health varies by age. Are younger or older individuals more likely to experience positive mental health benefits from music?

**Explore Music's Role in Managing Anxiety, and Depression:**
Analyze whether individuals who report feelings of anxiety or depression use music as a coping mechanism. Determine if specific patterns in music listening (e.g., genre or frequency) are linked to improved mental health outcomes in these groups.
